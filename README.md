## Introduction

Despite achieving strong performance in semi-supervised node classification task, graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, similar to other deep learning models. Existing researches focus on developing either robust GNN models or attack detection methods against adversarial attacks on graphs. However, little research attention is paid to the potential and practice of immunization to adversarial attacks on graphs. 

In this paper, we propose and formulate the **graph adversarial immunization** problem, i.e., vaccinating an affordable fraction of node pairs, connected or unconnected, to improve the certifiable robustness of graph against any admissible adversarial attack.

Figure shows effect of adversarial immunization on Karate club network. Colors differentiate nodes in two classes. We use two bars to represent nodeâ€™s robustness before and after immunization. The node is certified as robust (red), when its robustness > 0, otherwise as non-robust (pink). Purple circle indicates the node that becomes robust through immunization. The red edges are immune edges.



## AdvImmune

We further propose an effective algorithm, called AdvImmune, which optimizes with meta-gradient in a discrete way to circumvent the computationally expensive combinatorial optimization when solving the adversarial immunization problem.
